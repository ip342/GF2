Errors will be raised as soon as they are found during the parsing of the definition file.

Parsing will be able to resume continuing from the next punctuation symbol (;).

Develop custom error handling messages to return to the user for all syntax and semantic errors.

Error message should include a caret that points to the location of the error in the definition file.
