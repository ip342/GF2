A device must be initialised before being able to call any conections to it.

The device must be of the right gate type to be able to use specific connections such as .QBAR for DTYPE.

Connections may only be made to a device if that device has enough inputs, as defined in DEVICES.

The name to the left of the connections arrow -> must be a device output, and that to the right must be a device input.
